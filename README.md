NJIT TeleHelp-
Description: NJIT TeleHelp is attempting to solve the issue of isolation and get students more comfortable seeking help. In a new setting such as college, students tend to be more cautious and quiet as they are trying to grasp the new environment, making it difficult to get involved and ask for help. NJIT TeleHelp will provide the comfortable, safe, and easy access a student would need to overcome this hurdle. With features like selecting a counselor, scheduling appointments, and joining peer groups, NJIT TeleHelp will improve studentâ€™s college experience
